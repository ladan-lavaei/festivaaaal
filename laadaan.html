        <h3>The Original Story behind the Holi of Colors </h3>
        <p>
            The festival of Colors is celebrated all over India since ancient times. <br> Originally, the festival was an agricultural festival, celebrating the arrival of spring. <br> It represents throwing off the gloom of winter and enjoying the liveliness of spring. The legend associated with the festival involves an evil king called Hiranyakashipu. <br> He forbade his son from worshipping Vishnu. However, Radhu proceeded offering prayers to the gods. <br> Hiranyakashipu challenged Prahlad to sit on a pyre with his aunt Holika who was to be immune to fire. When the fire started, Holika was burnt to death whereas Prahlad survived without a scar. <br> Burning Holika is celebrated as Holi. <br>
        
         
        
        The morning after also known as Rangwali Holi is where people smear each other with colors and enjoy delicious gujiyas together, sharing the love. <br>
         Water guns and water-filled balloons are also a part of the celebrations, making every moment of the event memorable.

<h3>Colours of Holi</h3>
<p>
    In Mauritius, Holi is celebrated by nearly everyone, regardless of religion. Anyone out in an open area is fair game,<br> but only dry colours are used inside buildings or in doorways. <br> Traditionally, slightly more muted colours derived from plants were used but the vibrant pinks and neon yellows weâ€™re used to seeing today are water-based commercial pigments.
<br>
Markets and shops are painted in every color of the rainbow in the week leading up to the festival, setting the tone for the exuberance to come. <br> People throw handfuls of gulal (brightly colored powders) and soak each other with water jets known as pichkaris, made of local Mauritian bamboo stalks, on Holi morning.
